## Section 1: What is Machine Learning?

### 5. A Complete Walkthrough

#### Problem solving process

1. Identify the independent and dependent variables
   - `Features` are categories of data points that affect the value of a `label`
1. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
   - Datasets almost always cleanup of formatting
1. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
   - `Regression` used with continuous values, classification used with descrete values
1. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your `features` and `labels`
   - Many, many different algorithms exist, each with pros and cons
1. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction
   - Models relate the value of `features` to the value of `labels`

#### Methods

1. Classification : fewer or two options
   - The value of our labels belong to a discrete set
2. Regression : Arrange
   - The value of our labels belong to a continuous set

### 8. Identifying Relevant Data

| Feature         | Column                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Drop Position   | Bucket a ball lands in |
| Ball Bounciness |                        |
| Ball Size       |                        |

> Change one of Features -> Will probably change Column

### 11. What Type of Problem?

- we choose `Classification` -> Bucket #1 ~ #10
- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)
  - "Birds of a feather flock together"

### 12. How K-Nearest Neighbor Works

N-Nearest Neighbor (with one independent variable)

### 13. Lodash Review

[lodash doc](https://lodash.com/docs)

### 17. Interpreting Bad Results

1. Adjust the parameters of the analysis
   `const k = 3;`
2. Add more features to explain the analysis
3. Change the prediction point
4. Accept that maybe there isn't a good correlation

### 25. Updating KNN for Multiple Features

Start "2. Add more features to explain the analysis"

Pythagorean Theorem : a^2 + b^2 = c^2
