## Section 1: What is Machine Learning?

### 5. A Complete Walkthrough

#### Problem solving process

1. Identify the independent and dependent variables
   - `Features` are categories of data points that affect the value of a `label`
1. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
   - Datasets almost always cleanup of formatting
1. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
   - `Regression` used with continuous values, classification used with descrete values
1. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your `features` and `labels`
   - Many, many different algorithms exist, each with pros and cons
1. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction
   - Models relate the value of `features` to the value of `labels`

#### Methods

1. Classification : fewer or two options
   - The value of our labels belong to a discrete set
2. Regression : Arrange
   - The value of our labels belong to a continuous set

### 8. Identifying Relevant Data

![Plinko](./images/plinko.png)

| Feature         | Column                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Drop Position   | Bucket a ball lands in |
| Ball Bounciness |                        |
| Ball Size       |                        |

> Change one of Features -> Will probably change Column

### 11. What Type of Problem?

- we choose `Classification` -> Bucket #1 ~ #10
- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)
  - "Birds of a feather flock together"

### 12. How K-Nearest Neighbor Works

N-Nearest Neighbor (with one independent variable)

### 13. Lodash Review

[lodash doc](https://lodash.com/docs)

### 17. Interpreting Bad Results

1. Adjust the parameters of the analysis
   `const k = 3;`
2. Add more features to explain the analysis
3. Change the prediction point
4. Accept that maybe there isn't a good correlation

### 25. Updating KNN for Multiple Features

Start "2. Add more features to explain the analysis"

Pythagorean Theorem : a^2 + b^2 = c^2

### 26. Multi-Dimensional KNN

Pythagorean Theorem \
`C = (A ** 2 + B ** 2) ** 0.5`

```js
const outputs = [
  [40, 0.5, 16, 1],
  [150, 0.52, 16, 2],
  [350, 0.55, 16, 2],
  [425, 0.53, 16, 3]
];
const target = [323, 0.52, 16, 2];

C ** 2 = A ** 2 + B ** 2
C = (A ** 2 + B ** 2) ** 0.5
C = ((350 - 323) ** 2) + ((0.55 - 0.52) ** 2) ** 0.5
```

3D Pythagorean Theorem : a^2 + b^2 = c^2
`D = (A ** 2 + B ** 2 + C ** 2) ** 0.5`

### 30. Feature Normalization

`Normalized Dataset = (FeatureValue - min) / (max - min)`

### 33. Feature Selection with KNN

Not all features give us a good guess. \
Some features are not giving us good accuracy

### 35. Evaluating Different Feature Values

```js
the length of data:  1596
score.js:47 For feature of 0 accuracy: 0.32
score.js:47 For feature of 1 accuracy: 0.15
score.js:47 For feature of 2 accuracy: 0.03
```

dropPosition is a good selection feature \
bounciness and size are not

## Section 3: Onwards to Tensorflow JS!

### 36. Let's Get Our Bearings

- Features vs Labels
- Test vs Trainnig sets of data
- Feature Normalization
- Common data structures (arrays of arrays)
- Feature Selection

#### Lodash

- Pros
  - Methods for just about everything we need
  - Excellent API design (especially chain!)
  - Skills transferrable to other JS projects
- Cons
  - Extremely slow (relatively)
  - Not 'numbers' focused
  - Some things are awkward (getting a column of values)

#### Tensorflow JS

- Pros
  - Similar API to Lodash
  - Extremely fast for numeric calculations
  - Has a 'low level' linear algebra API + higher level API for ML
  - Similar api to numpy - popular Python numerical lib
- Cons
  - Still in active development

### 38. Tensor Shape and Dimension

[TesorFlow.js Doc](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/4.0.0/)

- `[]` : 1 Dimentional
- `[[]]` : 2 Dimentional
- `[[[]]]` : 3 Dimentional

#### Shape

```js
// 1 dimentional
[5, 10, 17].length -> [3] shape

// 2 dimentional
[
  [5, 10, 17],
  [5, 10, 17].length,
].length -> [2, 3] shape

// 3 dimentional
[
  [
    [5, 10, 17].length,
  ].length
].length -> [1, 1, 3] shape
```

> 2D is the most important dimention we will work with \
> [# rows, # columns] -> [2, 3]

### 41. Broadcasting Operations

Brodcasting works when

- Take shape of both tensor -> From right to left, the shapes are equal or one is '1'

- Shape[3] and Shape[1] => O
  - [3]
  - [1]
- Shape[2, 3] and Shape [2, 1] => O
  - [2, 3]
  - [2, 1]
- Shape[2, 3, 2] and Shape [3, 1] => O
  - [2, 3, 2]
  - [ , 3, 1]
- Shape[2, 3, 2] and Shape [2, 1] => X
  - [2, 3, 2]
  - [ , 2, 1]
