## Section 1: What is Machine Learning?

### 5. A Complete Walkthrough

#### Problem solving process

1. Identify the independent and dependent variables
   - `Features` are categories of data points that affect the value of a `label`
1. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
   - Datasets almost always cleanup of formatting
1. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
   - `Regression` used with continuous values, classification used with descrete values
1. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your `features` and `labels`
   - Many, many different algorithms exist, each with pros and cons
1. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction
   - Models relate the value of `features` to the value of `labels`

#### Methods

1. Classification : fewer or two options
   - The value of our labels belong to a discrete set
2. Regression : Arrange
   - The value of our labels belong to a continuous set
